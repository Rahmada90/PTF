## Alert *These codes just a prototype system codes*

* CNN : CNN model for tire prediction <br />
* Dataset : contains dataset for CNN model training
* Schematics : Our system schematics <br />
* Transmitter and Receiver : Contains transmitter-receiver code for tire pressure sensor <br />

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install on the vehicle's onboard PC

* [Arduino IDE](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-the-arduino-ide#1-overview) - Used for transmitter-receiver program
* [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) - Colaboratory space to run the CNN code
